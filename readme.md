## Intro

See the [live website](https://apple-ai.vercel.app) and [about page](https://apple-ai.vercel.app/about) for more info.

## Tech Stack

This site is [open source](${config.githubRepoUrl}). The hand-coded portions use:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

All of the content aside from this about page was generated using various AI tools.

### GPT-4 Press Release

[GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) was used to generate the Apple press release with the following prompt:

> Create a fictional letter on the Apple home page announcing two revolutionary new products: an AI LLM model called iThink which runs on-device powered by Apple's neural engine and M2 chip, and a brand new augmented reality (AR) product called iSight. iSight is a pair of enhanced contact lenses, which are powered by Apple’s iThink neural engine, featuring dual 4K displays, advanced body tracking, and controller-free input. iThink makes both ChatGPT and Google Bard look like child’s play in comparison, and with iSight, you won't ever have to worry about the real world again. Make it sound slightly ominous, dystopian, and condescending, but don't make it too obvious. It should be concise and poignant with a dystopian twist.

GPT-4 was also used to create all of the witty image captions.

### Midjourney Product Images

</p>

[Midjourney v5](https://www.midjourney.com/) was used to generate fake Apple product images, with the following prompt:

> sleek apple tech product photo of new AR contact lens, white background, clean, multicolored tinted case, 3d render, octane --v 5 --stylize 750

All of the other images were taken from either [Apple's WWDC website](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/) or [Black Mirror](https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888).
